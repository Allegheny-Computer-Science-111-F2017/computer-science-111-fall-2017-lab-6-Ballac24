# Reflection by

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. The first was to
replace the letters within the string of the DNA with their respective
compliments. When I first tried it I failed. I realized that I was simplying
replacing the letters within the string with the same letter. This caused the
letters to remain the same. I fixed this error by replacing each letter with a
random letter.

The hardest part of this lab assignment was to deleting a random letter. I
didn't understand how to delete the letters. To get around this dilema I gave
each letter a different character. When i was doing the lab it wasn't random.
The compliment wouldn't change. This is because I didn't declare the variable
"allowed". After I did this I solved my problem and changed the DNA sequence.

I understood how to choose the random character from the string. I didn't
understand how to get to delete the specific character. To delete it from the
string I had to create two different substrings that deleted the letter. It was
a simple step that I was missing. After I did all of the steps needed. I then
ran the program and found out that it was working. The DNA sequence was
changing everytime I ran the program.
